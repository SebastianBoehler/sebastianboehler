## The Negative Effects of High Carbon Dioxide Levels on Cognitive Function in the Home Environment

As a 21-year-old, I often found myself feeling tired and struggling to concentrate as the day went on. In an effort to improve my ability to focus, I began taking midday naps. While this helped somewhat, I still had difficulty completing challenging tasks in the afternoon. This led me to research potential causes for my difficulties with focus. One possibility I discovered was the level of carbon dioxide in the air. Upon implementing frequent room ventilation when I began to feel sluggish, I noticed an improvement in my ability to focus and complete more complex tasks.

Carbon dioxide (CO2) is a colorless, odorless gas that is essential for the survival of plants and animals. However, while small amounts of CO2 are necessary for life, **high levels of CO2 can negatively affect human health and cognitive function.** In particular, high levels of CO2 in indoor environments such as offices, bedrooms, and classrooms can significantly reduce our ability to think, make decisions, and perform at our best.

> "The effects of carbon dioxide are significant. High CO2 concentrations reduce IQ by 25 percent. And a 400-ppm increase in CO2 concentrations can lead to a 50% decrease in complex strategic thinking. This study shows that it is crucial to start addressing the effects of CO2 on human thinking."

One of the main ways in which high CO2 levels affect our cognitive function is by reducing the oxygen supply to the brain. When we breathe in air, the oxygen in the air is absorbed into our bloodstream and carried to our organs and tissues, including the brain. However, when there are high levels of CO2 in the air we breathe, the CO2 can displace the oxygen, resulting in a reduced oxygen supply to the brain. This can lead to a range of negative effects on brain function, including difficulty thinking, making decisions, and remembering things.

> "A very famous study by professor Joseph Allen of Harvard School of Public Health measured a 15% low cognitive ability score at 950 ppm and a further 50% decline at 1400 ppm. Through these findings, we can quantify the negative impact that high levels of CO2 can have on our level of concentration."

High CO2 levels can also cause other physical symptoms that can negatively impact cognitive function. These symptoms can include headache, fatigue, and dizziness, all of which can make it difficult to concentrate and perform at our best.

On nine scales of decision-making performance, test subjects showed significant reductions on six of the scales at CO2 levels of 1,000 parts per million (ppm) and large reductions on seven of the scales at 2,500 ppm. The most dramatic declines in performance, in which subjects were rated as “dysfunctional,” were for taking initiative and thinking strategically.

In addition to the physical effects of high CO2 levels on the body, there is also evidence to suggest that high levels of CO2 can have negative effects on our mood and emotions. For example, research has shown that high levels of CO2 can increase feelings of anxiety and stress, which can make it more difficult to focus and perform tasks.

There are several factors that can contribute to high CO2 levels in indoor environments. One of the main factors is the presence of too many people in a small space. When there are many people in a room, the amount of CO2 in the air can quickly rise due to the increased respiration and exhalation of CO2. Other factors that can contribute to high CO2 levels include poor ventilation, the use of certain types of furniture and building materials, and the presence of certain types of appliances and equipment.

To reduce the negative effects of high CO2 levels on cognitive function in the home environment, it is important to ensure that the air we breathe is properly ventilated. This can be achieved through the use of windows, fans, and air purifiers. It is also important to regularly clean and maintain appliances and equipment, as these can also contribute to high CO2 levels. Additionally, it is a good idea to avoid overcrowding rooms and to use furniture and building materials that do not contribute to high CO2 levels.

*The graph illustrates the effect of room ventilation on carbon dioxide (CO2) levels. At approximately 11 am, the CO2 level significantly decreased following ventilation and open windows, reaching a minimum of 400ppm. Subsequently, the CO2 level gradually increased throughout the day until the windows were opened again at 3 pm following my midday nap.*

In conclusion, high CO2 levels in indoor environments such as offices, bedrooms, and classrooms can have significant negative effects on cognitive function, including our ability to think, make decisions, and perform at our best. To protect our cognitive function and overall health, it is important to ensure that the air we breathe is properly ventilated and free of excess CO2.
