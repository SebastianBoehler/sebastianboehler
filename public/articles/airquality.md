## The Negative Effects of High Carbon Dioxide Levels on Cognitive Function in the Home Environment

# Introduction

As the day progresses I always start to feel tired, cant get any challenging work done and have a very hard time concentrating.
So I got used to a midday nap which improved my ability to focus again at least a bit so I only worked on really simple tasks in the afternoon where not much thinking is involved. I thought this isnt normal, I am 21 years, cant get throughout the day without a midday nap and even then cant really focused so I did some research on it. One day I read something about carbon dioxide levels and started ventilate the room frequently when I feel a bit down. No surprise I was able to focus and 

Carbon dioxide (CO2) is a colorless, odorless gas that is essential for the survival of plants and animals. However, while small amounts of CO2 are necessary for life, **high levels of CO2 can have negative effects on human health and cognitive function.** In particular, high levels of CO2 in indoor environments such as offices, bedrooms, and classrooms can significantly reduce our ability to think, make decisions, and perform at our best.

One of the main ways in which high CO2 levels affect our cognitive function is by reducing the oxygen supply to the brain. When we breathe in air, the oxygen in the air is absorbed into our bloodstream and carried to our organs and tissues, including the brain. However, when there are high levels of CO2 in the air we breathe, the CO2 can displace the oxygen, resulting in a reduced oxygen supply to the brain. This can lead to a range of negative effects on brain function, including difficulty thinking, making decisions, and remembering things.

High CO2 levels can also cause other physical symptoms that can negatively impact cognitive function. These symptoms can include headache, fatigue, and dizziness, all of which can make it difficult to concentrate and perform at our best.

In addition to the physical effects of high CO2 levels on the body, there is also evidence to suggest that high levels of CO2 can have negative effects on our mood and emotions. For example, research has shown that high levels of CO2 can increase feelings of anxiety and stress, which can make it more difficult to focus and perform tasks.

There are several factors that can contribute to high CO2 levels in indoor environments. One of the main factors is the presence of too many people in a small space. When there are many people in a room, the amount of CO2 in the air can quickly rise due to the increased respiration and exhalation of CO2. Other factors that can contribute to high CO2 levels include poor ventilation, the use of certain types of furniture and building materials, and the presence of certain types of appliances and equipment.

To reduce the negative effects of high CO2 levels on cognitive function in the home environment, it is important to ensure that the air we breathe is properly ventilated. This can be achieved through the use of windows, fans, and air purifiers. It is also important to regularly clean and maintain appliances and equipment, as these can also contribute to high CO2 levels. Additionally, it is a good idea to avoid overcrowding rooms and to use furniture and building materials that do not contribute to high CO2 levels.

In conclusion, high CO2 levels in indoor environments such as offices, bedrooms, and classrooms can have significant negative effects on cognitive function, including our ability to think, make decisions, and perform at our best. To protect our cognitive function and overall health, it is important to ensure that the air we breathe is properly ventilated and free of excess CO2.
